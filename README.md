Trying my hand at sympy.

## Experiment #1

The first experiment is to calculate the curl of a symbolic vector. The motivation is that I was watching a cool video from Rhett Allain (he's a great teacher/explainer) and it looked like he calculated the curl incorrectly (it happens and it's part of his charm). Anyway, this is where the rabbit trail led me :)

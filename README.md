Trying my hand at [sympy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html).

## Experiment #0

Just want to make sure that I have sympy installed correctly. If I do, then I should be able to run

```(shell)
[sympy-experiments] python3 src/experiment-0.py                                                     
>>>> x = 1
>>>> ok

```

## Experiment #1

The first experiment is to calculate the curl of a symbolic vector. The motivation came from watching a  video from Rhett Allain [Stoke's Theorem Example: Flux through different surfaces with the same boundary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc2kf8Tq7gE) which is a follow-on to the very nice video [Verifying Stoke's Theorem in Python with a Monte Carlo Flux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgwLXr5ZX6g) (he's a great teacher/explainer) and it looked like he calculated the curl incorrectly (it happens and it's part of his charm and I'm not trusting myself that he is wrong until I do this experiment :) ). Anyway, this is where the rabbit trail led me ... :D. Score one for the internet.
